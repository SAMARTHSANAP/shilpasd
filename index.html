        <p class="ps">Cube houses Dutch: kubuswoninge are a set of innovative houses built in the cities of Rotterdam
          and Helmond in the Netherlands, designed by architect Piet Blom. They are based on the concept of "living as
          an urban roof" high density housing with sufficient space on the ground level its main purpose being to
          optimize the space inside. Blom combatted the ideas of conventional residential architecture by tilting the
          cube shape on its corner and rested it upon a hexagon-shaped pylon. Blom's main goal was to create an urban
          area that felt like a village. The cube houses around the world are meant to optimize the space as a house and
          to efficiently distribute the rooms inside.</p>

        <p class="ps1">A gym, short for gymnasium, is a facility equipped with machines, weights, and space designed for
          physical exercise and fitness training. Modern gyms usually offer cardio equipment such as treadmills,
          stationary bikes, and rowing machines, along with strength-training equipment like dumbbells, barbells, and
          resistance machines. Many gyms also include functional training areas, yoga or aerobics studios, and sometimes
          swimming pools or saunas. They provide personal trainers and group classes to guide members toward their
          fitness goals. Regular workouts in a gym help improve strength, stamina, flexibility, and overall health,
          making gyms an essential part of modern healthy lifestyles.</p>

        <p class="ps2">A Ganesh temple is a sacred place dedicated to Lord Ganesha, the Hindu deity of wisdom,
          prosperity, and the remover of obstacles. These temples are often marked by the idol of Ganesha with an
          elephant head and a large belly, symbolizing knowledge and abundance. Devotees visit Ganesh temples especially
          on Ganesh Chaturthi, Tuesdays, and Sankashti Chaturthi to offer prayers, flowers, sweets like modaks, and seek
          blessings for success and happiness. The architecture of Ganesh temples varies, but most have a sanctum
          (garbhagriha), prayer hall, and beautifully decorated entrances. Visiting a Ganesh temple fosters peace,
          positivity, and spiritual strength.</p>

      <p class="ps4">A solar panel is a device that converts sunlight into electricity using photovoltaic (PV) cells.
        These panels are made of semiconductor materials, usually silicon, that absorb sunlight and generate direct
        current (DC) electricity. An inverter then converts DC into alternating current (AC), which is used to power
        homes, industries, and businesses. Solar panels are eco-friendly, renewable, and help reduce electricity bills
        as well as carbon emissions. They are widely used on rooftops, solar farms, and portable devices. With minimal
        maintenance and long durability, solar panels are becoming an important solution for sustainable energy and
        reducing dependence on fossil fuels.</p>
